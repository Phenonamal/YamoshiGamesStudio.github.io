    <h1 class="title">Welcome!</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">
        Hello, my name is Bashar Abbas. Ever since I was young I was always interested in programming. <br>
        I always thought "how are these websites or games even made?", thus I went out to do my own research<br>
        I started with HTML and CSS, because I always wanted to make my own website where I can post things on, turns out it's a lot more to it than I initially thought <br>
        Then I fell in love with Unity and c#, and have focused on that for as long as I can remember. However, I almost never finished any projects as the scope was too huge
        for the idea that I had at the time. I also had to deal with files being corrupt and data getting lost. <br>
        Game development is a big part of me now, it's who I am and what defines my talents. I always have been a fast learner, but I always do want to learn more programming languages
        to fully utilize my capabilities! Thus I went to learn MySQL, PHP, JS (which as current time of writing this am learning in my Software Development course), the languages 
        increased what I could do to a website substantially. From being able to create forums to creating blogs and portfolios. Where I can post about my projects and everything about me,
        it's a lot of great tools to had and I'm very glad that I've chosen this path of development. For more projects to come in the future and to proceed to create a career out of this!
