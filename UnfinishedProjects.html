  <h1 class="title">Anime Legends</h1>
  <h2 class="subtitle">
    Anime Legends is a Turn Based Anime Gacha Game with cubed like models. This game I've never gotten to fully complete, however it was a fun idea , but the scope was too huge for a solo person to complete. 
    Perhaps if I've gotten people to help me with the project I could've completed it, or gotten much further than now.  Right now the game has the main principles of the concepts done,
    you can summon characters and fight, but there's no skills for the characters and there's only 6 characters in the game. The saving/Loading data isn't fully finished yet either, hopefully when I get the time,
    I'll look at it again and improve it, but as of now I don't.

  <h1 class="title">Solar World</h1>
  <h2 class="subtitle">
    Solar World is a game me and my cousin have thougth of, it brings many concepts of multiple Anime RPG games such as Solo Leveling, Log Horizon and more. However back when I tried to work on this project,
    I wasn't too experienced with git and github, so all my data got lost and I had and still have no way to retrieve the data that I lost, even tho I created pretty much the combat and a shop, and a small world to play in.
    I did try to have a go at it again, but the scope for this project is way to big, that all I could create was a small prototype. Which I could show to people interested in this work.
    However this idea was mostly my cousin's and I couldn't work on it further as he quit being interested in it.
