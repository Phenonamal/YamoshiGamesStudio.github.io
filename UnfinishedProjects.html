  <p class="title">A little about this page:</p>
  <p class="subtitle">
    Here are all the prototypes/projects I couldn't finish, because of lack of motivation, disinterest or no time.
    I would like to mention that all these projects/prototypes are just done for fun and aren't by any means used for commercial purposes.
    I had a lot of fun making these projects and replicating the skills from the anime they come from.

  <p class="title">Anime Legends</p>
  <p class="subtitle">
    Anime Legends is a Turn Based Anime Gacha Game with cubed like models. The main inspiration for this game was Dragon Ball Legends, and other gacha like games.
    The game currently consists of 6 characters which can be summoned using the in game currency "gems", collecting multiple instances of the same character, would "stack it",
    which gives the character a star, each star boosts the damage of the character. Each character can block, basic attack, or use 4 different skills.
    For each turn you first decide what you'd like your char to do and afterwards, once both players are done with their turn.
    The battle sequence will start, in which all the attacks you've stacked up will perform in turns.

  <p class="title">Current Project (Name is a Work In Progress)</p>
  <p class="subtitle">
    This project is basically the same as the first project, however this time it's a trading card game.
    This is a online trading card game using anime characters as it's characters. Inspired by dragon ball z kakarot's card game.
    Currently not much to show besides some ui done. The yellow card you see on display right now, is what will show the rarity of the cards.
    For example: Gray = Common, Green = Uncommon, Blue =Rare, Purple = Epic and Yellow/Gold = Legendary.
